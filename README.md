# 🛠️ Greytools 🕵️‍♀️

Repository that contains a set of very small, almost useless tinconspicuous tools that have been crafted by yours truly over the years that I have been a sysadmin/devops. 

Many of these tools were originally written in languages like C and Bash, and they were quite the menace to maintain due to my occasional slip-ups with memory and the messy code I wrote.

However, I have since upgraded some of these tools to be written in Go, and I plan to share them with the world, provided that I have been granted permission to do so.

Hope you find something that helps you in your journey!

## 🚀 Tools

### 🔥 Teargas
Very simple REST API tester. Nothing too fancy, but it gets the job done.


### 🍒 Cranberry
Detects the use of console logging in a TypeScript project. It's a simple way to make sure that no pesky logging statements slip into your production code unnoticed.
